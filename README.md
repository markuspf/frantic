# Frantic

Frantic is a hobby project developing some lock-free data structures
and reclamation schemes in Rust. The principal goal at this point is
learning to implement efficient lock-free data structures in Rust.

Frantic is heavily inspired by Manuel PÃ¶ter's
[xenium](https://github.com/mpoeter/xenium) library (and by Manuel
himself).
